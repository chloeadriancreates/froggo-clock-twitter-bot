# Froggo'clock Twitter bot

The goal of this bot was to tweet a frog picture from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) every four hours, as many of my friends love frogs and I wanted to spread a little joy. The Twitter account it tweeted from is no longer updated, but the code lives on here, as I am still pretty proud of it!
